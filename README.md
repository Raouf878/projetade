This project was developped by CHERIBET DROUICHE Abderaouf for the ADE company (Alg√©rienne des eaux) in a 3 month internship.

This page allows the user to declare a new incident, first generating a new unique incident name, then choosing a map position by simply tapping on the map position, then choosing a team from a list of available teams, and finally choosing the appropriate equipment to repair this incident.
