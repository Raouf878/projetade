This project was developped by CHERIBET DROUICHE Abderaouf for the ADE company (Alg√©rienne des eaux) in a 3 month internship.

The main interface enables users to obtain general information on the number of incidents they have reported, the cost of incidents and the total number of teams available.

This page allows the user to declare a new incident, first generating a new unique incident name, then choosing a map position by simply tapping on the map position, then choosing a team from a list of available teams, and finally choosing the appropriate equipment to repair this incident.
